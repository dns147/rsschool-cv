## Summary  
The main reasons for searching for a job are the wish to change the type of activity, the wish to work in a company with a modern labor organization where a high status is given to the educational process, as well as the wish to increase the level of income.  

I am highly organized, efficient and proactive. I believe that my taste for learning, as evidenced by my graduate and postgraduate studies, allows me to quickly acquire the knowledge I need in my work. My experience as a leader will allow me to properly organize the work process, as well as to head up a team in the future.
